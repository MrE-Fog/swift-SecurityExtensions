This framework intends to make it easier to use some of Apple's Security framework APIs from Swift. I tested this on iOS. It may also work on OS X, didn't look into that. You're welcome to create pull requests :)

This framework requires Swift version 5.

Overview
--------
This framework provides the following primitives. There are unit tests; have a look at them for examples.

### SecCertificate Extensions

#### Create(derEncodedFile:)
Create a certificate by loading its content from a DER-encoded file:

    SecCertificate.create(derEncodedFile file: String) -> SecCertificate?

#### data
Get the certificate data in DER format:

    let cert: SecCertificate = ...
    let data: NSData = cert.data

#### publicKey
Get the certificate's public key:

    let cert: SecCertificate = ...
    let pubKey: SecKey? = cert.publickKey

### SecIdentity Extensions

#### certificate
Get the certificate associated with an identity:

    let identity: SecIdentity =  ...
    let cert: SecCertificate? = identity.certificate

#### privateKey
Get the identity's private key:

    let identity: SecIdentity =  ...
    let privateKey: SecKey? = identity.privateKey

### SecKey Extensions
Please note that encrypting only works if the key is a public key, and decrypting only works if the key is a private key. This is not verified by this framework, your application logic has to make sure it is done correctly.

#### encrypt()
Encrypt data or a string using the key. Make sure that the key is a public key, not a private key! Encryption uses PKCS1 padding.

    let plainText = "This is some plain text."
    let encrypted: [UInt8]? = publicKey.encrypt(plainText)

or:

    let plainBytes: [UInt8] = [1, 2, 3]
    let encrypted: [UInt8]? = publicKey.encrypt(plainBytes)

#### decrypt()
Decrypt to data or a string using the key. Make sure that the key is a private key, not a public key! Decryption uses PKCS1 padding.

    let encryptedBytes: [UInt8] = ...
    let plainText: String? = privateKey.decryptUtf8(encryptedBytes)

or:

    let encryptedBytes: [UInt8] = ...
    let plainBytes: [UInt8]? = privateKey.decrypt(encryptedBytes)

#### keyData
Returns the key's data if it could be retrieved from the keychain. In other words: this only works if the key is present in the keychain! See API documentation for details about data format.

    let key: SecKey = ...
    let keyData: [UInt8]? = key.keyData

#### create(withData:)
Creates a SecKey based on its raw data, as provided by `keyData`. The key is also imported into the keychain. If the key already existed in the keychain, it will simply be returned.

    let keyData: [UInt8] = ...
    let key: SecKey? = SecKey.create(withData: keyData)

#### generateKeyPair()
Generates a private-public key pair.

    let (privateKey, publicKey) = try SecKey.generateKeyPair(3072)

#### blockSize
Returns the block size of the key.

    let key: SecKey = ...
    let blockSize: Int = key.blockSize

#### sign()
Computes the digital signature of the given data using the current key. This assumes the key to be a private key.

    let data: [UInt8] = [1, 2, 3]
    let signature: [UInt8]? = privateKey.sign(data)

#### keychainTag
Returns the tag that was used to store the key in the keychain.

    let key: SecKey = ...
    let tag: String = key.keychainTag

#### keychainTag(forKeyData:)
Returns the tag of a key represented by the given data. Normally you should prefer using the instance property `keychainTag` instead.

    let keyData: [UInt8] = ...
    let tag: String = SecKey.keychainTag(forKeyData: keyData)

#### loadFromKeychain(tag:)
Loads a key from the keychain based on the tag. The tag is the string returned by `keychainTag`.

    let tag: String = ...
    let key: SecKey? = SecKey.loadFromKeychain(tag: tag)

### SequenceType
This framework also provides an extension to SequenceType that allows creating a hexadecimal string representation of a byte array.

#### hexString()
Creates a string representation of a byte array (`[UInt8]`) by concatenating the hexadecimal representation of all bytes. The string _does not_ include the prefix '0x' that is commonly used to indicate hexadecimal representations. This is the inverse function of `String.hexByteArray()`.

    let bytes: [UInt8] = [0, 1, 2, 255]
    let hexString = bytes.hexString() // "0x000102ff"

### String
The inverse function of `hexString` is implemented in an extension of `String`.

#### hexByteArray()
Converts a string containing the hexadecimal representation of a byte to a byte array. The string must not contain anything else. It may optionally start with the prefix '0x'. Conversion is case insensitive. This is the inverse function of `[UInt8].hexString()`.

    let hexString = "0xdeadbeef"
    let bytes: [UInt8]? = hexString.hexByteArray() // [0xde, 0xad, 0xbe, 0xff]

Usage
-----
The easiest way to use this library is using Swift Package Manager or [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). For CocoaPods, put something like this in your `Podfile`:

    pod 'SecurityExtensions', '~> 4.0'
